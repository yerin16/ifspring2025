                        <h3>Public Reactions and Controversies</h3>
                        <p>The slogan "Keep Portland Weird" has created controversy and been imitated with slogans such as "Keep
                            Portland Beered" and others. Also suggested is that Portland might not have been originally weird,
                            but the campaign leads to a new weirdness among some Portlanders. Not all citizens view the campaign
                            in a positive light. Some have advanced the idea that Portland's weirdness is an excuse for the
                            younger generation to be underachievers. Also some citizens claim that the intended effect of the
                            campaign—economic stimulation for local businesses—has not achieved the desired results.</p>

                        <h3>Political Debate and Civil Liberties</h3>
                        <p>In early 2011, the "Keep Portland Weird" slogan was used in a debate about Portland's refusal to join
                            the federal government's Joint Terrorism Task Force. Portland originally opted out of the task force
                            in 2005 over concerns for civil liberties. Recent potential threats have prompted local officials to
                            reconsider joining the task force. Those opposed to joining the task force adopted the "Keep
                            Portland Weird" slogan to point out that Portland was different from other cities and should
                            continue to opt out of the task force and not join with other government forces. Opposing citizens
                            felt joining the task force could have potentially affected Portland's traditionally progressive
                            stance on civil liberties.</p>
