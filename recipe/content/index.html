            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
                <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 10 to 12 minutes. Drain and transfer to a pasta bowl.</li>
                <li>While the pasta is cooking, combine olive oil and garlic in a cold skillet.</li>
                <li>Cook over medium heat to slowly toast garlic, about 10 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low when olive oil begins to bubble. Cook and stir until garlic is golden brown, about another 5 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
                <li>Stir red pepper flakes, salt, and black pepper into pasta.</li>
                <li>Pour in hot olive oil and garlic, and sprinkle on Italian parsley and half of the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese; toss until combined.</li>
                <li>Serve pasta topped with the remaining Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Non-recipe Websites</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><a href="https://httpster.net/" target="_blank">httpster</a>: I like how they organize the scrolling bar with a ruler design ordered by months. I might use this technique by labeling each step on the scrolling bar.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.hoverstat.es/" target="_blank">hoverstat.es</a>: I like the animation they put on the main screen when I first get into the website. This technique could be applied to my recipe website by showing the animation of making my chosen dish on the main screen.</li>
                <li><a href="https://goodui.org/" target="_blank">goodui</a>: Each step is indicated clearly with a black circle and a large font size, which is slightly outdented. This clearly highlights each section and emphasizes the user's progression through the steps, making the interface more intuitive and easy to follow.</li>
